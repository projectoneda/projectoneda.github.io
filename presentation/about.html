                    <p>Wisdom Wealth Management was established in 2014 with a generous gift from the families of Sir Donald L. "The Don" Walker, Jr., 
                        the former CEO and founder of Walker Global Enterprises and Lady Layal Gallez founder and CEO of Gallez Holdings Incorporated. Sir Walker and Lady Gallez were also the company's original
                        Council of Overseers members. </p>
                    <p>Despite a volatile and challenging stock market, Wisdom Wealth Management continues to generate impressive returns and its 
                        fund managers are continually featured on CNBC. Comprised of finance professionals, selected through a rigorous application and interview process, 
                        the fund provides handsome returns to its clients, and a chance for clients and local university students to have a hands-on opportunity to learn, 
                        develop, and apply effective stock analysis and portfolio management risk and return techniques.</p>
